The program asks the user to input details regarding if they are entering a student or an employee of the school. If the employee is chosen it asks other questions to see if the user is entering a faculty member or staff member. Once all the information is entered into the system the program prints the data back out to the user in a certain format. This uses Oject Oriented Design.
